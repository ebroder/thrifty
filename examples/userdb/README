Simple client/server example from using the Thrift definition file
from http://thrift.apache.org/.

To test it out, do the following:

- Run 'bundle'
- Run 'bundle exec ruby server.rb' in one terminal. Leave it running.
- Run 'bundle exec ruby client.rb' in another terminal.

You should see something like the following from the client:

```
Storing <UserProfile uid:1234, name:"my name!", blurb:"your name!">
Retrieved <UserProfile uid:1234, name:"my name!", blurb:"your name!">
```
